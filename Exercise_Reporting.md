### Guidance for Lab Exercises

The following suggestions are intended to provide guidance toward
completing and reporting lab exercises. The larger umbrella of guidance
is to ask for every element of your lab exercise, “does this help with
reproducibility?” because ultimately lab exercises should be
reproducible science.

**For each lab exercise question, a naive reader should be able to read
the question, see any relevant code that was implemented to get the
answer, and then clearly understand what the answer is.**

Specifically:

1.  Include the question. Answers are often out of context without
    copying the question that is being addressed.

2.  Include only the *necessary* code to answer the question. A little
    more code for context is OK, but it can be a slippery slope that
    results in adding a lot of unnecessary code. For every line of code
    you include, make sure it advances to the answer.

3.  Answer the question. This may seem odd to say after you have added
    the code, but if the compiled code is not 100% obvious, please add
    text that clearly states what the answer is. In other words, simply
    including the correct code may not be enough if you do not directly
    answer the question. You may want to take your answer out of the
    code format and just report as plain text, in order to make it
    clear.

4.  Use code chunk options to remove unnecessary warnings and other
    compilations that are not part of the answer. Yes, it is complete
    transparency to include them, but if they are just not important,
    then do not include. An example of unimportant warnings and messages
    you should exclude are those that often come with libriares. Loading
    a library will often produce a message that the library was built
    under a certain verison of R. This is nice, but if it is not
    relevant and doesn’t change how the code is run, it is just a
    distraction in the exercise.
