Assignment 3: Literature Review
================
DAR
Spring 2021

### Introduction

Each student will review a published article evaluating the data
analytical aspects of the paper. The critique will evaluate the
methods–to the extent the paper discusses data manipulation, the
analytical techniques used, and the presentation (visualization) of the
data and results. In other words, use your knowledge of data analysis
you have developed this semester to evaluate a paper that has at least
one moderate flaw.

**This assignment accounts for 10% of your course grade.**

### Tips

1.  Find a paper that has a manageable data analytical section. Consider
    older literature as recent papers may present statistical analyses
    that go beyond what we cover in class.
2.  You don’t need to evaluate every aspect of an analysis. But evaluate
    enough to feel you have covered the intention of the analysis.
3.  With your knowledge of data manipulation, models and estimation, and
    statistical assumptions, consider how well the paper has reported
    and handled each of these (and other) considerations that make an
    analysis complete. Review lecture notes to recall the steps and
    information needed in a statistical analysis. (Hint: Is the model
    correct? Was the estimation documented? Were multiple models
    evaluated? How was the model fit evaluated and reported? Were the
    data subject to any biases? Could random effects have been used?
    What alternate model might you propose? Is the visual reporting
    complete, or could another figure or two be included to highlight
    the results?)
4.  Keep in mind that one goal of any scientific report or paper is for
    the reader to be able to reproduce it. Discuss your confidence that
    you would be able to reproduce the work if provided the data (i.e.,
    not the data collection).

### Deliverable

Your deliverable will be a 1-page (single spaced) written critique of
the paper, again, focusing on the methods. This assignment is **due as a
hard copy by 12pm on Friday March 26, 2021.**
