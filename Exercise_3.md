Exercise 3: Packages
================
DAR Lab
Spring 2021

This week’s lab exercise is simple. Please identify two R packages that
you have personal interest in–either in learning or because you find
them useful. **Email me by 5pm Tuesday, February 9 a short
markdown-compiled html file** that:

1.  lists the two libraries,
2.  very briefly describes their general family of functions or
    application, and
3.  highlights one function of interest.

If you can run an example using the function, that would be great. But I
recognize some functions might require additional pieces to run, and so
a laypersons description of the function is acceptable. We will share
our libraries and functions in lab. Remember, the job is to shed light,
not to master.
